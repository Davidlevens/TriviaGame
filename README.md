# TriviaGame
homework_05
For this assignment, I created a multiple choice trivia game with a countdown timer and 3 answer counters. It is deigned using minimal Bootstrap html layout, JavaScript and jQuery. I also used a fairly large css file to style the elements.
When you click on the start button, the onclick function loads the game elemnents and starts the countdown timer. there are 20 seconds to choose an answer or the timer runs out, and a Times Up! element shows up under the questions and scores unanswered on a counter to be shown on the final page at the end of the game.
The project is useful in learning how to manipulate thw DOM, and the use of jQuery to make it easier to create the counters and timer. I also find it useful in reminding me about html and css. It is easy at this point to forget the basics as we get deeper into JavaScript.
Anyone who is interested in attempting a project like this should start with jQuery on click notation and additional functions as arguments to manipulate the DOM. The use of "for" loops and if, else if and else conditionals are used in making the various counters keep track of the scores.
I used github as a great resource, and then lots of Googling to help with some of the issues that I encountered along the way.
It was a lot of work, but there is great satisfaction getting it work the way you envisioned.
Good Luck!
